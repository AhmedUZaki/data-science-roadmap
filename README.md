# Data Science Roadmap

Self taught **Data Science** curriculum.

### About
This repository intendend to provide a complete **Data Science** learning path to those who intersted in learning Data Science. In this repository, I gave preference to free resource. However, some valuable paid courses also included.

I used different emojis for different resources.
:tv: represents videos.
:dollar: represents paid content.
:newspaper: represents online article.
:file_folder: represents GitHub repo.
